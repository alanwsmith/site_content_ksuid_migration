title: Expect A Flash Of Unstyled Content (FOUC) In Dev With Tailwind 2 and Gatsby
type: post

I was seeing a Flash Of Unstyled Content (FOUC) in my Gatsby site after installing Tailwind 2 via the [documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/gatsby). 

Turns out that it does this when you run `gatsby develop`, but when you build the site with `gatsby build` the issue goes away. (Or, at least, it did with my small sample, TBD for larger builds, but it looks promising)
