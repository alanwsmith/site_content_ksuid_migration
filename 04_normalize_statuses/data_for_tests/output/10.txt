title: 'DRAFT: Advice for New Streamers'

_NOTE: This is a work in progress. It started when someone on a discord asked me if I had any tips for streaming. Right now, it's mostly snippets and mini-drafts that include a lot of repetition. This is how I write._

_While working to put this together I realized the most critical thing is to figure out the question of 'why' stream. I ended up writing a piece to answer to that question. You can [read it here](/the-reason-i-stream-is-because-it-makes-me-a-better-developer/)._

I've got 100 or so streams under my belt. A little experience, but I still remember the start clearly. From that perspective, here's my take on getting started:

### The Number One Thing

- Stream.

    That's what it's all about. 

    Do as little as possible to get to 


### Quick Start (In 5 easy steps)

1. Get [OBS](https://obsproject.com)
2. [Sign up](https://www.twitch.tv/) for a Twitch account
3. [Make a Stream Key](https://dashboard.twitch.tv/u/theidofalan/settings/channel)
4. Put the Stream Key in OBS
5. click "Start Streaming"

This isn't a real stream. It's just getting the wires hooked up. But you want that out of the way. 


### Notes


- As long as you have a camera and mic, you're good to go. The ones in laptops are perfect starters. 

- Don't tell anyone you're streaming. The first ones are just for you to test with. 

- Don't look at the viewer counter. The only things you want to watch are your follower alerts and chat. You can pop those out from the management console 


### Get the tech stuff out of the way

Don't think of this as streaming. This is the work before the work. Just stuff to bounce through.

- Download and install . It's free. 

- for a Twitch account.

- Make a stream key and put it in OBS. 

- Fire it up and see if works. Don't worry about setting up your camera. Just broadcast the screen. 


### Testing

- Do this as soon as you put in your stream key. Consider it the last step of your setup.

- Don't tell anyone your doing this. This is just making sure the wires are connected. 

- Don't turn on the camera. Just broadcast the screen with the mic on. 

- Don't worry about what to say, just do something like musicians do during sound check and say: "Check Test. One, two. One, two". Describe the room, or whatever else, just talk a little to see the meters move on OBS


talk into the mic a little. Do the thing musicians do during sound check. Just say, "Check Test, one, two. One, two.".


- You're going to do five streams. These aren't real streams. They're tests.

- You're going to do them all in a row. Stream for 2 minutes. Watch it. Do the next. 

- Two goals here:

    1. Get used to the process of starting and stopping

    2. Adjust your setup a little



- I believe in the Shitty First Draft. Just do one. But don't tell anybody. It's for you to get your feet wet. 

- Test a couple times first. Like, do some streams for 45 seconds. 

- Your first ones are 

Get the first one out of the way so you can get on to the second one


First thing to do is a test. 

Shitty first draft. 


- Make a checklist
- Do test streams
- Don't look at viewers
- Only look at followers and chat
- Figure it out as you go
- Don't worry about a schedule. Don't worry about anything other than getting a video to show up. 
- Don't worry about a face cam.
- It's easy to get caught up in ideas and the quest for a better setup and not actually do any streaming.
