Was browsing around the library yesterday and saw "Absolute
Sandman" sitting out and waiting to be re-shelved. Here's what
Wikipedia says about it: 

Reprinting The Sandman issues \#1-20. The
more than 65 pages of bonus material include the original proposal
for the series and the full script and pencil art for issue 19. And
about the Absolute Editions in general: DC Comics Absolute Edition
is a series of archival quality printings of graphic novels
published by DC Comics and Wildstorm Productions. Each is presented
in a hardcover, dustjacketed and slipcased edition with cloth
bookmark consisting of one or more books which include restored,
corrected and recolored versions of the original work, reprinted at
8 inches by 12 inches. Also included are supplemental materials
regarding the creation of the work, including sketches, comic
scripts, memos, etc. Kinda surprised me that the library had a
comic book collection, but I don't guess it should have.
