The other day, I forgot the word "acronym". The closest I could
come up with was "abbreviation". I use acronyms all the time, but
rarely call them by their title. It was a weird experience. I tried
to search for it on the google, but had no luck. Nothing I
described in my search worked out. I kept getting actual acronyms,
but never what they were called. It just clicked back in place for
some reason. Use it or lose it, I suppose.
