I'm trying out the
[Spelling Checker plug-in for WordPress from coldforged.org](http://www.coldforged.org/spelling-checker-plugin-for-wordpress/).
It seems to work nicely and I like the interface. According to the
author of the plug-in, it piggy backs off of the open source
package [Speller Pages](http://spellerpages.sourceforge.net/) for
the core functionality. Open Source is sooooo very cool. This is a
great example of it literally building on itself and becoming
greater than the sum of its parts. One note, the default install of
the plug-in didn't work for me with out changing the "Aspell
language" from "en\_US" to "en". Before I made that change I got
and error that listed the aspell command it was trying to run
followed by the string "Error: X?w". Once I made changed the
language option it kicked up just fine. By default, the plug-in
only adds a spell check button to the place where you create new
entries. Directions are included on the main scripts page for how
to added the spell check button to the comments area as well. I've
done this as well since I'm bad at spelling and want to not make a
fool out of myself when adding comments.
