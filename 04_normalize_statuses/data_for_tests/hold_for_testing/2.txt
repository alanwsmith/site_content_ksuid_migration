UPDate: I need to update this. As I've kicked it around a little,
it's changed..... I'll get to that someday. 

We live in the "The Age of the Internet", "The Information Age",
"The Digital Age", or any of a dozen or so other really important
sounding names. I don't think those titles are quite right. I have
a feeling the Internet along with vast amounts of digitally stored
information are with us effectively from this point forward. The
historians will figure out what they want to call it and their name
is gonna stick because none of us are likely to be around to
argue.  

Call it what you will. The more important thing is what we've seen:
the seemingly exponential growth of technology in the guise of
computers, the web, digital cameras, e-mail, and all the other
forms that surround us. While a lot of these technologies have
older roots, I think it's safe to say that for the average person
the first exposure and perceived birth of all this has happened in
barely more than the past decade.  

So, what is this all about? I was lucky enough to be at least a
little involved in a lot of those technologies early on and I still
make my living working on the web. As a result, I get asked a lot
of questions about a lot of technology related things. Part of my
plan for this blog is to simply talk about some of the things I see
and have seen. With luck it'll help answer some of those questions
or get someone thinking about something new.  

A lot of the focus is likely to be on software, computers, the web
and photography. Of course, I will also post about things I find
annoying, interesting, just plain cool, etc... And last, but not
least, as mandated by the fact that I'm a tech guy, part of my plan
for this blog involves world domination. But, we'll get to that
later.  

I hope you enjoy,
