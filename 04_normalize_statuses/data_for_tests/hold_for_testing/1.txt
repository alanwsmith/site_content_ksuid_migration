title: A refined thought on "Great Artists Steal"
type: post
---

A gentleman named [Jeff Veen](http://www.veen.com/jeff/index.html)
giving a talk at an [Ignite](http://ignite.oreilly.com/) show about
the idea of "Good artists copy. Great artists steal." He focuses a
little on the iPhone with points I think are valid, but that's just
an example for the underlying idea and its refinement. I love the
way he describes it.

To me, the the way he talks about stealing is more about learning
from someone/something and then using what you learn to create
something new for the world. What a great take on things.
