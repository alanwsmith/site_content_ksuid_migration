Vonage has an ad going right now that does a great job of holding
your attention. In the foreground is a guy standing outside a
building talking about Vonage's service. In the background a guy in
a bright red lobster suit starts passing out flyers. The lobster
guy gets fed up with sometihng and then tries to go inside the
building but gets stuck in a rotating door. It's hard not to watch.
You might be thinking this has nothing to do with Vonage, but the
fact that you are thinking about them at all is what they are
looking for.
